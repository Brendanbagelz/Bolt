    How it Works
  </b>
</h1>
<p>
  Night uses <a href="https://github.com/titaniumnetwork-dev/Ultraviolet">Ultraviolet</a>, a proxy backend provided from Titanium Network. Ultraviolet v3 is a hyperfast proxy service that beats out every other service. However, Ultraviolet's sucessor, <a href="https://github.com/MercuryWorkshop/scramjet">Scramjet</a>, is in the works. Once Scramjet is ready for production, Night will use both Ultraviolet and Scramjet to optimize performance and speed.
