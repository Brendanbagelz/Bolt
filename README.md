    How it Works
  </b>
</h1>
<p>
  Night uses <a href="https://github.com/titaniumnetwork-dev/Ultraviolet">Ultraviolet</a>, a proxy backend provided from Titanium Network. Ultraviolet v3 is a hyperfast proxy service that beats out every other service. However, Ultraviolet's sucessor, <a href="https://github.com/MercuryWorkshop/scramjet">Scramjet</a>, is in the works. Once Scramjet is ready for production, Night will use both Ultraviolet and Scramjet to optimize performance and speed.

  <b>
    Why Night is Better than other Proxies
  </b>
</h1>
<p>
  If you have used proxy sites such as <a href="https://github.com/UseInterstellar/Interstellar">Interstellar</a> before, you know that they are not very fast or powerful. This is becuase sites like Interstellar use outdated proxy services such as Ultraviolet <b><i>v2</i></b> and <a href="https://github.com/NebulaServices/Dynamic">Dynamic</a>. Ultraviolet v2 is outdated and uses Bare, which is old and not secure. Dynamic is very slow, and does not support many sites.

  <b>
    Supported Sites
  </b>
</h1>
<p>
  Because Night is so powerful, it supports many popular sites. Some sites that it support are:

  -<b>GeForce NOW</b><br>
  -<b>Now.gg</b><br>
  -<b>Youtube</b><br>
  -<b>TikTok</b><br>
  -<b>Snapchat</b><br>
</p>

    Usage
  </b>
</h1>
<p>
  To use Night, you must deploy it. You <b><i>CANNOT</i></b> deploy to services such as <br><br>
  -Vercel<br>
  -Netlify<br>
  -Github Pages<br>
  -StackBlitz<br><br>
  because they either do not support Wisp, service workers, or are static.<br>

  You CAN deploy to:<br><br>
  -Codeanywhere<br>
  -Gitpod<br>
  -Koyeb<br>
  -CodeSandbox<br>
  -Github Codespaces<br>
</p>
